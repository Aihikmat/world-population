# World Population Visualization

## Overview

This project visualizes world population data from 1955 to 2023, obtained from Worldometer through web scraping. Multiple scraping operations were performed due to the data being distributed across different tables on the website.

## Data Retrieval

The data was scraped in several steps to collect comprehensive information. The following visualizations were then created using the retrieved data:

## Visualizations

1. **Choropleth Map:**
    - The choropleth map provides a visual representation of world population per country.
    - It allows users to quickly identify population density and variations across different regions.

2. **Heatmap:**
    - The heatmap displays world population data per country.
    - It offers an alternative perspective, highlighting concentration and distribution patterns.

3. **Line Chart - Total World Population Progress:**
    - The line chart illustrates the progression of total world population over the years.
    - It helps viewers understand the overall trend and growth rate.

4. **Tables:**
    - Several tables are included to showcase top countries in various categories:
        - Land Area (kmÂ²)
        - Fertility Rate (%)
        - Median Age
        - Urban Population (%)
